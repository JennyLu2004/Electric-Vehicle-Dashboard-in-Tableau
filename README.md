# A Dashboard On Electric Vehicles in the U.S.
This is a self-initiated project I developed during my free time to explore insights about electric vehicles in the United States.

The dashboard provides detailed information about electric vehicles, including their Model, Make, Year, and Type (Fully Electric or Hybrid), etc.

Through this interactive dashboard, you can explore:

- The total number of electric vehicles
- A U.S. map showing the distribution of electric vehicles by state
- The annual production of electric vehicles (2011–2024)
- The Top 5 most popular makes and models
…and much more!
