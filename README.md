# A Dashboard On Electric Vehicles in the U.S.
This is a self-initiated project that I created in my free time. 
The dashboard contains details about electric vehicles in the United States, including Model, Make, Year, Type (Fully Electric / Hybrid), and more.
Through this interactive dashboard, you can see: 
- The total number of electric vehicles
- A map of the U.S. that shows the distribution of electric vehicles by states
- The number of electric vehicles manufactured by year (2011 - 2024)
- Top 5 most popular vehicles by make
And more! Discover the dashboard for yourself in Tableau Public by clicking on this link: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/thao.lu6343/viz/Electric_Vehicle_Dashboard_17324843935220/Dashboard1
